/// NetworkMonitor is a class responsible for monitoring the network status of the device.
///
/// This class provides functionality to observe changes in the network connectivity of the device.
/// It uses the Network.framework to monitor network paths and publishes updates to its `isOnline` property,
/// which indicates whether the device is currently connected to the internet.
///
/// USAGE:
///
///     - Create an instance of NetworkMonitor to start monitoring network status.
///     - Subscribe to the `isOnline` property to receive updates about the device's connectivity.
